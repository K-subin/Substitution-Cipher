As we have discussed, the new ext4 filesystem brings many new features and enhancements to ext3, making it a good choice for a variety of workloads. A tremendous amount of work has gone into bringing ext4 to Linux, with a busy roadmap ahead to finalize ext4 for production use. What was once essentially a simple filesystem has become an enterprise-ready solution, with a good balance of scalability, reliability, performance and stability. Soon, the ext3 user community will have the option to upgrade their filesystem and take advantage of the newest generation of the ext family.
The authors would like to extend their thanks to JeanNoel Cordenner and Valerie Clement, for their help on performance testing and analysis, and development and support of ext4.
We would also like to give special thanks to Andrew Morton for supporting ext4, and helping to bring ext4 to mainline Linux. We also owe thanks to all ext4 developers who work hard to make the filesystem better.
Finally thank you to all ext3 users who have put their faith in the filesystem, and inspire us to strive to make ext4 better.
